@Twitch You should really worry about all your LGBTQ oddballs that you have working for, and streaming on your platform. Are they Monkeypox vaxxed?
@QuotesrusF @LinnellGrace @MegJC28 Oh no! I’m so sorry! My daughter got the jab against my wishes last Nov. She’s currently pregnant and I worry. She is now scared of Monkeypox and I’m afraid she’ll possibly take it too. Been reading people getting infected after vax with that one also. My trust is lost.
If you are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine, walk-ins are available in Winnipeg today, August 24, and tomorrow, August 25. Stop by the clinic at 490 Hargrave St from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. For details, visit .
Here’s a typical appearing rash from the #intradermal #monkeypox #vaccine. Redness is typical but if the swelling gets worse w/ increased pain or discharge, please see your doctor.
Can we get the monkey pox vaccine? Im not tryna have a sore rectum
It was decidedly less of a sausage fest for monkeypox vax round 2, than it was round one. More like the hotdogs you get at 711. And, honestly, thank God. That was waaay too many hot gay men in one place at once. There could of been a fire 🔥🥵
This monkeypox vaccine got me with the worse headache 😐😐
No plans for the BH weekend apart from a walk with a friend tomorrow, my monkeypox vaccine at last, and a solo trip to IKEA. 3 days of relaxation, enjoying my own company and letting my mind relax. Can’t wait 🥰🥰🥰

@Wildyena It's always been a case of -when-, not -if-. Thanks to all the covidiots *cough*maga/anti-vax*cough* out there. Monkeypox is following in the footsteps of AIDs, sadly. It'll bloom before the idiots go, "Oooooh.. It CAN infect us heteros! Where's the vax before it's too late!"
I have absolutely no reason to worry about monkeypox and I have no intention of getting any of the current "vaccines". When they produce a REAL vaccine in the time-honored and well-tested manner, I might reconsider.
Omg was anyone else’s arm sore after the monkeypox vax

when it comes to monkey pox there a lot of body aches and horrible head aches and so much mucus and your animals can get it and if you don't get a vaccine or do you can get it more than once. You have to get rid of all cloths furniture blankets and don't donate it please.
In Europe, the global monkeypox hot spot, the latest outbreak has disturbing echoes of Covid-19, for which stocks of protective gear, tests and vaccine were initially inadequate, hampered by production bottlenecks, and distributed at uneven speeds.
@pthncwsqrrl @OldYesButWise They completely think that vaccines stop Covid and Monkeypox is a gay thing.. the guy is 91 yrs old.. not sure what to say about it. He saw I had heat exhaustion and AC broken and was worried about me :/
I figured out why I've been so restless: monkeypox vaccine is making me drowsy, restless, and body aches! Also the injection area is still red and itchy 😣
@hjarche @BobTeskey The thread from @nthlstrgn seems to indicate Jennifer Russell is trying hard to downplay monkeypox. Meanwhile, past outbreaks have had serious death rates in children, but improved over time. Not as bad in recent years. It is not an STI. Don’t panic but we need vaccines.

With this, I worry authoritarian officials who once supported no-vaccines &amp; “I have a right to not get vaccinated” will turn 180 degrees if monkeypox or polio ravish our nation. Think about the Nov vote!!

Shout out to the guy I walked into the monkeypox vaccine clinic with, he’s a real one
@jh45123 @OANN think of it this way, a lot of people have dormant herpes zoster. when the vax begins to erode their immune system, as it does, suddenly they break out in shingles (or monkey pox, if you are trying to hide the fact that the vax does it)/nchicken pox. many other diseases too
had a cold brew on my walk to my second dose of the monkeypox vaccine and now i am in desperate need of a bathroom, yall think the clinic will let me use theirs?
Later in the dream, I broke away with this hot guy (not my ex or my fiancé!} and we were about to hook up when I discovered I was covered in monkeypox blisters that hadn’t been there before. I felt so ashamed and he was angry because he wasn’t vaccinated. /2

@ParentMishmash @Snoo_mama @FinchTH My mom got it and I finally felt like I could breathe the tiniest bit. Now it’s just gone, like my hoped-for sense of relief with my eldest being vaxxed (LOL Omicron) and my youngest (yay Monkeypox). It just never gets better.

Today, the @ZSFGCare monkeypox vaccine clinic administered more than 600 doses. All walk-ins received a vaccination and wait times decreased. The clinic will reopen for walk-ins tomorrow, 8am-noon and on Saturday, Aug 13 from 8am-3:30 p.m.
Im having a little local reaction and some flu like symptoms today. Still better than after my first COVID vaccine, but I’m terribly sleepy. Monkeypox goes under the skin and not as an intramural thing injection, so my arm isn’t sore. #monkeypox #monkeypoxvaccine
Got that MonkeyPox vaxx #2 and was a sweaty ripe mess by the time I got done ... its all good though... daddy loves being sweaty n ripe 🙃😉😋
@PatriotEst1962 Do not panic. Most of them are associated with side effects of the COVID vaccines. and If monkey Pox does not get you, then Shingles will. Millions of cases or shingles reported and all associated with COVID vaccines.
We want to say a huge thank you to everyone sharing information about today's walk in #monkeypox vaccination event./n/nIt's vital to share correct and relevent information. It helps people make the decision that's right for them.

@CillianDeGascun @mugecevik Any link between the monkey pox/shingles and the MRNA drug.

I’m getting the monkeypox vaccine sunday finally and I’m just curious, did you guys have any side effects like a fever or anything after getting the shot?

I'm still itchy this morning?? could it be a delayed reaction to monkeypox vax or something? I've still got a firm lump and bruise at the injection site and I've been feeling a little under the weather in general. just wish it'd go away
@Wayne33335593 @CoolL33tStuff @UKHSA It's believed that it started at 2 raves in Europe. /nThe majority infected with monkeypox are gay &amp;  bisexual men. The vaccine is for those have have symptoms and anyone who has been in close contact with them. So if you're not in this category then you don't need to worry.

#Monkeypox hasn’t killed (much) so far but it’s boils are so painful they lead to hospitalization for pain control. Recall your last 2 bouts of #COVID- diagnosed on routine test-asymptomatic- or mildly symptomatic- “a cold” - which disease will hurt more? $BVNRY has the only vax.

I'm looking at the surging numbers of monkeypox cases and more depressingly, the inequity in the accessibility of vaccines globally. Once again, rich countries have hoarded the vaccines, forcing poorer countries to compete with each other for scarce supplies or to go without.
@AmericansVsGOP Let's not stop w/ the GOP! We need to shut down the U.S.P.S. for anyone who is not triple vaxxed &amp; practices double masking. Exceptions can be made to anyone identifying as male who has participated in the spread of Monkeypox. Sores must be clearly visible to receive exemption.
In preparation for the MSM fear porn coming this fall, let’s remember the following:/n/nPolio = Guillain-Barre Syndrome caused by the vax/nMonkeypox = shingles caused by the vax
@ThomasW89412605 @Real_Malarkey @Angry_Staffer Thankfully *most* children and adults are vaccinated against polio, still.  (Unlike monkeypox, where only those old enough (or military) for the small pox vaccine are protected).
MONKEYPOX VAX is available for walk ins for first and second dose! No line at all and you can register here :)
Of course she forgets everything, she is stressed out by Covid, and monkeypox, every single minute of every day./n/nBtw if she vaxed? None of these long covid, and higher rates of this and that after covid, studies uses an unvaxed control group.
@michelemunz @MatiH_ID Shouldn't it be limited to the high risk? From what we know so far, monkeypox is essentially another STD... So if you're not sleeping around, or have close contact where you exchange bodily fluids, why would you need the vaccine? You can't compare this to COVID, spreads different
Managed to pick the right bus and get to the stop but I was on the wrong side so I had to power walk my way to the appointment but I got the first half of the monkeypox vax and they thought I was cis lol
Monkey pox symptoms... gain of function disease crossed animal-human barrier? Hmmm symptoms? Sore throat, swolen glands, rashes, etc...early symptoms of hiv in vaxxed?/nHmmm. ?
day two after monkeypox vaccine, i no longer feel like hell but i wish the injection spot would stop being so itchy and red. Overall, very much not the worst post vaccine experience i’ve had
So I pretty much got all the vaccines one can get and I am worried about Monkeypox and polio. I know people who have 0 vaccine because they think it is evil chemicals. I pray for them.

So excited to hear @Boghuma speak on Monkeypox vaccination and antiviral treatments during today's APHA @PublicHealth x @theNAMedicine webinar "Monkeypox: The State of the Science." I will never tire of thinking about drug discovery and global health. Thinking about patents &amp; IP.
The @CDCgov's guidance for intradermal use of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine considers it a vaccination error if "no visible 'wheal' was formed"/n/nThe agency recommends that vaccinators /n/n"Repeat dose immediately via intended route (no minimum interval)."

@_MrAutumn_ @WH_Birdy @ClayTravis That was weak.  First response was kind of funny, but obviously not factual.  You can’t get monkeypox from women, just when you get you let your buddies fuck you without a condom.   Use protection even when you are blowing them too.  Enjoy your vaccinations!!!
Monkeypox vaccination absolutely kicking my ass today.  Not in a scary way, just in a perpetually exhausted way./n/nI mean, I fell asleep watching Star Trek IV: The One with the Whales last night.  That should not be possible.

@my_bijutsu @VanIslandHealth @VCHhealthcare @adriandix Happy you got an appt — was this for the monkeypox vaccine? When I called @VanIslandHealth at the end of July, I was told there was no supply on Van Island &amp; to keep checking back for appts so I booked with @VCHhealthcare. Worried about barriers this creates for those at risk.

@lapublichealth  I had the vax for monkeypox 2  days ago and today start been swollen and itchy like a mosquito bite is that normal?
@mayalayla0524 @FriedmanJas @loisrp @thrasherxy There are a lot of diseases we don't vaccinate everyone from such as bubbanic plague and yellow fever or even monkeypox which existed before now lol depending on multiple factors.
@eli_ja601 @CartierCarys @ScientistSwanda @BNOFeed I'm worried about the lack of vaccinations for Monkeypox however.
The fact that it’s nearly impossible to get a second monkeypox vaccine dose in new york city, but you can basically just walk into the fire island clinic and get one is a pretty distrubing illustration of the racist and classist effects of our public policy and health system.
@ThatSarahLynn @Ezekiel144k We are the temple. Christ said "not made with human hands, don't you know you're the temple?" So AOD was set up in the temple 2020. Why Rev 16:2 grievous sores (monkeypox, HIV, sm pox) is only in those who took jabs. Father of the vax, op WARp SpEED' into chimeric beasts is SOP
Not sure if anyone else in here has gotten the Monkeypox vaccine yet, but I got my first dose of Jynneos on Sunday. The effects have been mild.  Just some fatigue &amp; headaches (could be unrelated, I'm a spoonie) and some light soreness, redness, &amp; swelling at the injection site.
I have a breakthrough Monkeypox infection. I was vaccinated over a month ago and now I have painful sores all over my ass /n/nAll people even vaccinated please be careful. The NP i spoke with said every single case she talked to had been a breakthrough case.
Anyone who has received the #MonkeyPoxVaccine experiencing late on-set arm pain? /n/nIt literally feels like a little ball has formed at the vaccine site. Its so tender to the touch. Didn’t even experience this with COVID vaccine. #MonkeyPox
Kidnapping, Rape, Killings, Inflation, Increased tax, Monkeypox, No DOH Secretary, Increasing COVID-19 cases, F2F class issues, Billions of Expired Vaccines, salt, sugar and oil price hikes, crowds outside DSWD starving and tired. Denial of History. /n/nWhere is ur voted president?
This is *absolutely wild.* Still no open #monkeypox vaccine events scheduled in San Diego. There haven’t been any walk-in clinics.

MORNING EDITION: MONKEYPOX VACCINE SUPPLY – TUE. AUG. 16 AT 5AM/nAs monkeypox continues to spread globally, governments of wealthy nations have been scrambling to buy vaccines. Now, experts are worried that countries with fewer resources won’t be able to afford them.

@greta Adjectives are opinion. "The Hill" likened the monkey pox response to the Covid response with its 'sluggish' vaccine.  Sluggish? 9 months has NEVER been done./n/nIt's propaganda from Pravda.

@llanier67 The vax is NOT 4 COVID. COVID is a herd trim of the weak &amp; a $ grab &amp; a trigger 4 the vax for the REALLY dangerous virus. I do not know why ppl do not c that. It's SO OBVS. Well documented all over the biomed community. Monkeypox was doc'd as an ideal bioweapon yrs ago on PubMed

@okayshane_ As parents, we often only have the bandwidth to worry about things that have already happened. Most of us have our hands full fighting existing Covid vaccine and mask mandates. If they go after our kids with the Monkeypox vaccine, they will be met with fierce resistance.
Getting my monkeypox vaccine:/nNurse: "Do you have an allergy to eggs or chicken?"/nMe: "No. But I don't eat them."/nNurse: "Because you can't?"/nMe: "No, because I chose not to. Many years ago, I ate them with great success."/n/nWHY CAN'T ANXIOUS ME PHRASE THINGS NORMALLY?
Got my #monkeypox #vaccine yesterday because I’m gay and straight people don’t breathe. 🙄
@edo_ardoroma @BNOFeed "the coof is less of a concern now that the CDC says vaccination status doesn't matter, HIV isn't as bad because there's tons of drugs to throw at it, and monkeypox only matters for a few days as you try not to fuck other people. But as long as you're not degenerate you're fine."
@RolandBakerIII @padme911 @AIDSHealthcare @WHO @AndrewNoymer @NCDCgov Whatever it is, cases are dropping in New York City and Los Angeles. Vaccines? Behavior modification? Exhausted pool of potential infectees? But it's not spreading outside the initial community in which infections were focused.
Walked past someone getting the monkeypox vaccine in the city today. #blessed #GetVaccinated #monkeypox
I'm having the monkeypox vaccine on Monday. Apart from the usual inject side effects (sore arm etc.), are there any MPX-specific side effects I need to be aware of/expect?

Monkeypox: demand for vaccines is outstripping supply – this is what's causing the shortages. Chronic weaknesses in our global vaccine manufacturing and distribution systems may broadly be to blame.
Day 2 post monkeypox vax. Flu like symptoms continue. Rash around injection site more than doubled. Itchiness is maddening. SD card for scale.
Today, the @ZSFGCare Monkeypox vaccine clinic gave out approximately 380 doses. Our supply has been exhausted for the day. We are now closed and will reopen on Monday, Aug 21 from 8 am to 4 pm
Hot girls get their Monkeypox vaccine
Still got an achy arm 1 week after my monkeypox vaccine/n/nGrateful but achy 🤣🤣🤣👏
Monkeypox vaccine update: there is a red circle on my arm that started out dime sized and is now silver dollar sized, warm to the touch and itchy. Unsure of this is normal or not.
New cases of monkeypox are showing signs of slowing down in hot spots including New York City, which health officials attribute to vaccinations and outreach, @dmosbergen and @jon_kamp report  via @WSJ
One shot, five hit. #FDA is allowing to give #vaccines in between layers of skin to address the shortage of vaccines for #monkeypox. This method worked for #polio and yellow fever, however there’s only one study like that about monkeypox.

@CPHO_Canada Close contact and respiratory droplets. We are walking into this unprepared again. Not enough vaccine, not enough medication, no imposed quarantine, no protection with a crumbling healthcare system seeing healthcare workers in burn out. Both COVID-19 and Monkeypox for fall.

It’s painful that the British Government &amp; NHS have this near perfect national vaccine rollout infrastructure and they’re just not using it for monkeypox vaccines.
Monkey pox, now bunny "pox", next it will be the birds and insects. just stay indoors everyone, don't breathe the air, wash your food, don't fart, be careful where you step, do not have sex, and make sure you get vaxed and all will be well again with your world. Beyond ridiculous
@heathclif304 @travismeyn Hey mate is there a vax available for monkey pox yet ? I got my 4th covid jab today but I’m worried about this monkey pox going around
St. John’s getting it done again, administering the Jynneos Monkeypox vaccine using intradermal injection method. Less pain, more gain - expanding the # of doses for people in need

@WBEZreset @MilaKoumpilova @KateGrossman1 I’m a teacher and I’m not vaxxed and not worried about Covid. Also Monkeypox isn’t something I or my students are at risk for since it’s an STD
@notdred I will say this, when 10yo had his checkup earlier this month I asked about polio (it’s still part of normal vaccinations, yay) and Monkeypox. Pediatrician said not to worry, it’s not even on the radar (of peds). And I REALLY trust that guy.

ngl I got the monkeypox vaccine on Sunday and it had me in a very small lethargic blender for the past two days
@wwsnoopy1 @jilevin Nope, I just got worried about monkeypox &amp; didn’t know if I’d had the smallpox jab or not so started looking up which vaccines give which scars 😆 it was stopped in ‘71 in the UK (my birth year) but it’s given before 3 months, so that’s my scar.
@RamtinEte I said the same thing! The reason I got tested is I was worried I had MonkeyPox as the symptoms are similar.  I was low key “phew ok thank god it’s just COVID” Cause even though I’ve had the MonkeyPox vaccine, it’s too soon for it to fully work as it needs a minimum of 14 days.
San Francisco ONLY received 60 monkey pox vaccines!  That’s it! Be smart!  Demand appropriate testing and get vaccinated! You do not want this…as isolation for Monkeypox is 3-4 weeks and til your sores heal.

More quick hits! /n/nMonkeypox is an STD or STI: False, but sexual contact is still driving the spread/n/nGetting the smallpox vaccine as a kid protects against monkeypox: Likely, but any immunity may wane /n/nMonkeypox can spread through shaking hands or hugging: Not likely, LOW risk
Well I was planning to go get a monkeypox vaccine at the walk in today but because my HIV care is provided by the infectious diseases dept at North Manchester hospital instead of the sexual health dept at North Manchester hospital I'm not eligible!!
i am so angry right now that i can't schedule my *second* monkeypox vaccine.  i'm due and stanford stopped giving them out because the counties are doing it, but the counties aren't giving out second doses.

Monkeypox vaccines need to be rolled out immediately. Saw a homeless man walk past me with scabs all over his hands and it’s clear it’s monkeypox, so incredibly sad. This country is failing us again.
if you are 55years or older, you do not have to worry about monkey pox, you already have the vaccine shot in you, it the small pox vaccine, they stopped giving in may of 1967, all they have to do is make more

@vannenanne Don’t worry - you can still get vaxxed for monkeypox!
just walked past @rvc330 getting the monkeypox vaccine
@ladielabrys Shit, here I am worried about everyone calling monkeypox a gay disease, and I didn't consider that there are women and straight people who don't think that at all but just want access to the vaccine. 😬 Homophobia hurts everybody, just like toxic masculinity/patriarchy.

I worry that @HSELive will reject the EMA advice on intradermal vaccination because there currently isn’t the infrastructure to vaccinate 6000 people for #monkeypox - in large part because of underfunded sexual health services!
"‘Frustration and Stress’: State Officials Fault Rollout of Monkeypox Vaccine" by #health @LussianaK
@jogginsboy …….I got my US visa. Compare and contrast with my smallpox jab which I got c. 50 years ago which will probably still  be good against monkey pox. What irritates is that the current crop of covid vaccines were oversold.
@EnemyInAState We’ve got more than 500 cases of Monkeypox in Canada - that we know of, but there’s little sense of urgency. More like, ok, we’ll, let’s not worry cause 99 per cent of cases are in gay men - and we’ve got some vaccines, and whatever, it’s
fujoshis walking past the monkeypox vaccine clinic
@KarinaB75978165 @ECooperAuthor Monkey pox is a cake walk. Easier than an sti. Just gotta wait it out like chicken pox. If you’ve been vaccinated for smallpox which, which they stopped doing in the 70’s , you are likely protected. If not there is a vaccine that’s been around a while. The shingles vax no work
My monkey pox vaccine arm is still so sore after a week 😵‍💫
DELAYING SECOND DOSE OF MONKEYPOX VACCINE: Why not to worry? So, usual vaccine strategy for Jynneos is 1 dose followed by 2nd dose 4 weeks later but resource scarcity making cities delay 2nd dose until more supply available
The 2nd monkeypox vaccine shot..the injection area is itchy &amp; swollen.
If anyone is looking to get the monkeypox vaccine the SSA Regional Office in Santa Ana is taking walk ins until 7pm!! ❣️❣️
This walk in line for monkeypox vaccine was to Oilcan. Mf that’s basically the block.
I walked into the health clinic and he said “Monkeypox vaccine? Down the hall to the right.”
‘Frustration and stress:’ State officials are faulting the rollout of the monkeypox vaccine. Federal officials are not relying on an established system to distribute the vaccine, slowing immunizations &amp; burdening local health departments, critics say
@ianeastlondon @SparrowhawkAlex @UKHSA @THTorguk @HIViBase @APPG_HIV_AIDS @BritishHIVAssoc @BASHH_UK @NAT_AIDS_Trust @TeamPrepster @ukcab I know that the vaccine is not 100% protective against Monkeypox, but pleased I managed to get it./nGoing forward as a community I am worried as none of us know what is going to happen.

This monkeypox vax left a huge ass red knot that’s itchy on my damn arm like whewww thank god I finally got it but😮‍💨
@jillian_swaine They should be giving vaccines to gay &amp; bisexual men with multiple partners &amp; other people in their sexual networks. Passengers on a plane, no matter how long the flight, are at minimal risk unless they have skin to skin contact with someone with monkeypox sores.
@FlipTheScr1pt @Monkeypoxtally FYI - the Jynneos vaccine is only 80-85% effective (full dose) and does not stop symptoms or spread or kill Monkeypox. Now that they're cutting doses down to 20% of the proper amount.. It won't do shit!/nA LOT of people are gonna need TPOXX to cure those painful lesions in future.

Can Baby Boomers quit worrying monkeypox if they were vaccinated against smallpox as kids?
Slight prob, I'd do CPR even if they had so-called covid... if they took vax or monkeypox,  then they kind of made their bed tragically. Apparently... only 5 percent out of hospital cardiac failure events survive.
Today, @ZSFGCare monkeypox vax clinic administered 478 doses. All walk-ins were served. The clinic will be open tomorrow, Wed Aug 17 from 8am–4pm. We will update the community with more clinic hours when we receive information about additional doses.
@Joel_Finkel @zoeharcombe Rubbish. You've fallen for the scare tatics. I bet you're panicing over monkeypox now too? Waiting to get the vaccine for that?
@Ring_Sheryl @Toadcialism The U.S. recently had enough of the smallpox/monkeypox vaccine that we could have eradicated monkeypox from the world by giving it away to countries where it is endemic. Instead, we let the vaccines expire and threw them away.

For anyone thinking about getting the Monkeypox vaccine:/n/nAbout a week after receiving it, the injection site swelled up into a lump. We haven't had any ill effects of it and that is apparently a common thing. It was sensitive to touch and it feels a little itchy.
Me walking into any gay’s house that I know got the monkeypox vax
Update on my monkeypox vaccine, first dose./nJust like a mosquito bite. Its been a week and the itchiness is much less often, the red mark is smaller and still there. No other symptoms :)
Until we know more about how effective these vaccines are, worth remembering they are not an impenetrable shield. #Monkeypox infection is associated with significant pain and suffering. Avoiding high risk exposures is still the best option even if vaccinated.
Am I the only person who has been itchy as fuck since getting the monkeypox vaccine. #sideeffects 🙃💉
@Stonekettle Since the Monkeypox vaccine is about 100% efficacy I’m all in favor of the inbred dumbass rednecks not getting vaccinated and just wondering why their itchy bumps seem to spread to their dumb family members.
@lilynlilac Oh Lord!!  There is a Monkey Pox vaccine I think. Go to Walmart and get the Artic air fan. It hangs around your neck. There 3 speeds. It costs 30 dollars. Battery operated with a plug in. I got one for work. It is hot as hell there. All the residents are cold all the time
In 2003, a 1st gen vaccine was used in that #monkeypox outbreak without much consternation. I worry that with the anti-vaccine forces so energized that continuing to over emphasize risks of 1st gene vaccines may compromise their acceptability to the public if needed for smallpox
Everyone needs to take a deep breath before accepting the mass vaccination against monkey pox being envisaged. Smallpox vaccine saved many lives but it was not without severe effects in some people.
mostly i wanted the vaccine bc if i get monkeypox it would absolutely set off my trypophobia and it would be constant crying and upset and i'm in enough sweaty, close contact situations to be mildly concerned at all times lol
Beginning at 12pm today, all DC Health monkeypox clinics will offer limited walk-up vaccinations to eligible residents. /n/nVaccinations will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis (while supply lasts) to eligible residents who have not received a first dose.
I read a post today about solar energy and why that person is against it, his reasoning “if we use solar energy then the sun will just die faster”. Their timeline also mentions how the COVID-19 vaccines created Monkeypox
Symptoms of monkeypox can be similar to, but milder, than the symptoms of smallpox. Some of the initial symptoms you should look out for are: /n✔️ Fever/n✔️ Headache/n✔️ Muscle aches/n✔️ Swollen lymph nodes/n/nYou can pre-register for your vaccine appointment at
I will also throw hands to get a monkeypox vaccine

@VP Your vaccinations make it worse. You have more than monkeypox knocking at your door. We have already discussed this. Don’t be ignorant. Ignorance is darkness.
Arm is super sore where they gave me the monkeypox vaccine.
Dr. Lewis cited a limited study from the 1980s, which showed smallpox vaccines used at the time were about 85 percent effective against monkeypox. It's unclear what current vaccine's overall efficacy will be, but stressed importance of vaccination to protect those at high risk.
SFPD has the ability to hold people in custody withIN SF General Hospital all the time (it’s one of the reasons there are sheriffs) Is this person getting any treatment?  Vaccine access? Pain relief? Masks? We have so many questions…

Guys—monkey pox is spreading in LA. The disease can be very painful &amp; is very contagious; can transmitted sexually or even by touching an infected person’s clothing. Take 10 mins. to read this. /nVaccines are currently available to very limited populations.
Legit wanna rip my arm off with how itchy it is from getting that fucking monkeypox vaccine
My fucking doctor brushed off my concerns about COVID and monkeypox. I should worry about COVID because I'm vaxxed, and monkeypox is "primarily spread between homosexual men" (THIS IS NOT TRUE) 🤢🤢🤢 please someone save me from this hell
@ChristineEliaz @heidiology And we might need to bring that vax back for this damn monkey pox too. Ugh. I'm so tired.

During the @WHO media briefing declaring monkeypox a PHEIC, when asked about vaccines, Tim Nguyen mentioned, besides the BN and LC16 vaccines, the stockpiles of ACAM2000 countries have. I felt a shiver down my spine. I’m glad that at least right now they’re not seen as an option.

So for those considering the monkeypox vaccine:  both people I know who got it have swollen lumps at the injection site (any fat they can find on the back of your arm).  One had a sore throat for days; the other has been drowsy for days.
@DrDadSays @nytimes Concern is warranted. But the news reports of this case, in which the children were always at low risk of #monkeypox even without the use of the vaccine, only inspired hysteria and excessive fear and worry among parents.

I called the @RichmondCity_HD to inquire about getting the Monkey Pox vaccine &amp; was told that "it's is really rare." The message was that I didn't need to worry about it. As far as I can tell, there are no ways to get vaccinated in Central VA. This is not great.
@jenkinshelen I absolutely maintain that panicking people about a cVDPV outbreak because the word "polio" is scary is horribly irresponsible when vaccine rates outside of that county are above herd immunity levels and it risks alert fatigue when monkeypox is a much greater threat right now

I got my monkeypox vaccine today and whew the sheer relief. These plagues are stressing me out
@RadicallyJust One of my friends had monkeypox. He was out of work for almost 2 weeks and had a lot of pain. His husband got the vaccine and hasn't had any problems with it.
Monkeypox symptoms include fever, rash or blisters in mouth/around genital areas, swollen lymph nodes &amp; muscle aches. Know the symptoms, get vaccinated if eligible &amp; stay vigilant:  #MonkeypoxAwareness
During monkeypox briefing, @FDACBER Peter Marks states FDA is comfortable with 8-hr storage of Jynneos vaccine in syringes, similar to dating for vials after first puncture. That may give vaccination sites a little breathing room for making workflows more efficient. #TwitteRx
@WCCO All us baby boomers have nothing to worry about. We had the small pox vaccine as children. It protects against the monkey pox virus.
exhausted bc of the monkeypox vax, it's cool my body is cooking up all this immunity but rude for it to be happening on a weekend
to anyone who is looking into getting their monkeypox vaccine, a little red lump in your arm might stay there for 1-2 weeks. it's common and might be a little itchy. just wanted people to know.

so I'm like 36 hours post monkeypox vaccine and the only side effect I've noticed is my arm is a little sore but it's very much localized to right where the injection was so it's not that bad at all
@AlixWzl @EepJeep @Doc_Wolverine Really, I wasn't particularly worried about monkeypox, I was just asking if he thought I needed the vax, but his reaction sounded so close to the "It's just a gay disease" response, I was worried, but I guess it wasn't what he was saying.
@rmarksteffen @PierrePoilievre Before I came to chinada I never heard of peanut butter allergy at least so much paranoia evrywhere I thought someone could hijack a plane with a bag of peanuts..., i never seen so many people worried for their life.

That’s right Mr. President tell them a thing or two. These puffed up billionaires and millionaires getting rich off of our sweat creating vaccines that they know clearly does not and will not work (still get sick), Now this monkeypox which is another billion dollar scheme
@geno_md What a jerk. I have two dogs and (and I happen to live in Paris). I have been lucky to avoid Monkeypox and have had first dose of vaccine. If I caught Monkeypox my dogs would be at risk as I pet them so much and they also sleep with me in my bed.

@AngelaDesjard10 Pfizer attacked my nervous system and thyroid horribly etc so NO boosters.  Tam the ugly witch can take all the boosters.   Apparently she needs them.  Her face says she may already have monkey pox
@mtreyens I'm worried about monkeypox in particular bc I had a lot of swelling and a huge itchy bump after my shot. People who are vax hesitant and got nervous about their Covid shots would freak the fuck out and never get their second shot
@LizHighleyman They will probably end up vaccinating many of the worried ones./n/nMany here are telling and instructing others how to lie to get Covid booster shots when they wouldn't be otherwise eligible. Why wouldn't they do the same for monkeypox.

Ngl, I hate this new type of monkeypox vax shot. This one is way more inflamed and itchy as fuuuuuuck
@ChaniceEkenkow I am not worried about this since the island is vastly vaccinated against small pox. They are in the same family and monkey pox is the less severe version of the two.

Good news. There is a vaccine for the latest viral scourge,  MonkeyPox. Bad news. As with all vaccines, there are side effects. People who have received the MonkeyPox shot report headaches, a slight fever, and an uncontrollable urge to sling feces at anyone who stared at them.

@UNLVRebelGrl Point taken about the vaccines. Monkeypox however is transmissible via air, skin to skin, etc. Imagine if there's 10,000 cases a day in the community? Everything you touch, try on, even breathing indoor air, could be potentially problematic.

@JakeNiemeyer It's the straight people and children of straight people I am worried about being disease vectors. Monkeypox has already been stigmatized as a "gay disease" so there's a huge portion of the population that won't get the vaccine or let their kids cause "I'm not gay bro."

Got my second #monkeypox vaccine yesterday.  Today my forearm swelled up like a ball and it’s red and itchy at the injection site.  Hopefully I will be fully protected in a few weeks.  Get the vaccine, stop the spread.

Ok, booked my monkeypox vaccine appointment for Monday. Used the DC Health online registration and hope it works out. I know they're also doing walk-ins.
@TOPublicHealth what’s the point of having people register for the Monkeypox vaccine if you are letting a high line of walk-ins go ahead? The whole point of making an appointment is to NOT wait in huge lines.
@vax_rl @hanginsack @GK_UK_Tennis @todayyearsoldig Being British is like walking around knowing you have Covid and Monkeypox tbh.
So one of the side effects of the Monkeypox vax is it can cause a flare up of eczema or other skin irritations...  and guess who is having a flare up. Fml

For those who get the monkeypox vax, I just got mine. It's intradermal not intramuscular. Once it dispersed, fatigue set it really really quick. Others haven't had this reaction but I definitely recommend not getting it on a work day in case you have the same reaction as me
arm ache from the monkeypox vaccine!! means it do be working!!!
i just looked at my baby record book &amp; i got all my polio vaccines! yay! i'm not too worried about polio - just covid &amp; monkeypox &amp; the climate &amp; capitalism &amp; lack of empathy, mask mandates, healthcare, education funds, the cost of living rising while wages remain the same, etc.
Got my first dose of the monkeypox vax. Feeling grateful, and very tired. If you’d like to send supper to my door it would be much appreciated.
@Media_Critic_ @varbmos @0rf You got me bro. You're so far gone, you think asking someone to take a vaccine is an actual burn. And you don't even understand science. Monkey pox isn't a pandemic, why would people vaccinate against it? It's like you don't understand science.
We've had a fantastic response to the monkeypox (MPXV) survey so far. Thanks to the 800 gay and bi men and nonbinary folk who have responded in the last 3 days. It's really clear vaccine access is a hot topic! Please share/retweet. Access survey here:
No one warned us that this Monkeypox Vaccine would cause arm pain for 7 days.
me PERSONALLY fuck yeah i would wanna mask up in a crowded confined place. trolls would fake a sneeze just because or someone actually has covid and/or monkeypox. for the vaccine,not really a must imo
If you are in  high risk group to get monkeypox please get vaccinated. I hear it can be very painful.
Can confirm I am vaccinated, now can return to only being worried about covid and monkeypox and not the whole trifecta.
@HeyNurseKat No worries, he isn't vaxxed so can go about freely &amp; not worry about catching monkeypox etc.

@GenetAfterDark We know a lot more about monkeypox than we still do about COVID. Everything we do is measured risk. Things to keep in mind. /n-it is most contagious when sores are visable/n-it is not fatal and hospitalizations are for symptom management/n-the vax works AFTER exposure as well
the bump on my arm from the monkeypox vax is evidently a very normal reaction so im not worried about it but it is VERY annoying &gt;:c
@Lynnenallo @Angry_Staffer Well, if you’re taking normal precautions for Covid (wear a mask in public, social distancing, &amp; frequent hand washing) this are the same rec’s for monkeypox, which is what you’d need the smallpox vax for. They are working on a more specific vax, though. Not released yet.

Important guidance regarding #monkeypox &amp; #psoriasis Key point: #JYNNEOS vax ok for those w weakened immune system or an exfoliative skin dz such as psoriasis. #ACAM2000 vax contraindicated for many psoriasis pts. #dermtwitter #epitwitter @AADmember
@covid_parent Please advise how to protect my breath after I dispel it. I am worried it might mix with unvaccinated breath. I am 4 x vax + monkeypox &amp; want to reclaim my breath as it emanated from me. If it contains traces of me can I be adversely affected by non-vax breath?
the monkeypox vaccine has me sleeping for days
@dogloverluna123 Absolutely sickening. Thankfully they got rid of the vaccine passport though. I worry though wkrh the new “monkeypox” strain these nazis will try and pull the same stunt
@ArkangelosX @joyce_m_morgan @pontificatormax This monkey pox stuff.  Sounds a lot like the “grievous sores” in Revelation.  And people are saying it’s mainly people who got the vax that get monkey pox.  Though I haven’t confirmed that,,yet.

So my monkeypox vaccine seems to have developed a sore “ball” under my arms skin. Anyone else have that problem?
No. It's being *transmitted through* sex. It's being driven by global neglect of vaccines, tests, and treatments./n/nThe refusal to say gay sex "drives" epidemics is because that language got me called "MONKEYPOX" as I walked down the street.

Walk-in monkeypox vaccine clinic held in Newark  #news #trending #breaking_news
It is barely 8:15 on a Saturday morning and the queue is probably 200 deep, that's my estimated position for the 9:00 AM walk-in for the #monkeypox vaccine. I hope they have enough in stock for this. If anything, gay men are concerned, anxious, and very responsible people.
Hot take: limiting monkeypox vaccine access only to sexually active gay men elevates the stigma surrounding the disease and will lead to disastrous consequences when, not if, it spreads to other population groups, like schoolkids, the elderly, and the chronically ill.
@sfchronicle I asked my doctor at Kaiser to authorize a monkeypox vaccine because I will be going to Burning Man.  She refused.  #nextpandemic

If ur worried abt the monkeypox vaccine, NYC and the CDC both say that the vaccine is NOT the same as the smallpox vaccine (so it won't protect u from the former), and also that the side effects r pretty much the same as COVID vac side effects. It's also 2 dosages 28 days apart.
Well this psoriasis flare-up is gonna go over LIKE A LEAD BALLOON in the monkeypox vaccine line

@elonmusk Soon @elonmusk  will declare a global pandemic of monkeypox in January, all restrictions will be introduced again and those who are vaccinated will start to get sick. The rest will panic. And all this to hide the economic collapse of the states and the transition. It's a joke =))
@TheSurvivalPodc I agree. Not worried in the slightest about the monkey pox. Just wouldn't mind the smallpox vax as a "just in case" since it is a vax that is actually proven to be quite safe, and I think there are smallpox samples out there not really accounted for.
