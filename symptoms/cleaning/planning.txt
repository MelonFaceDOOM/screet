So far I've removed a bunch of symptoms that got 0 matches across 3 datasets, and also symptoms with very low positive rates for personal report.

I want to modify aefis so that they are the cleanest/best version of themselves

modify tweets table to remove apostrophes:
old:
ts TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', tweet_text)) STORED
new:
ts TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', replace(tweet_text, '''',''))) STORED
I copied this from stack overflow but i feel like it should be "'", "" instead of '''',''
and replace tsquery portion of search func too:
old:
        cur.execute(f'''SELECT * FROM vaccine_tweets
                        WHERE ts @@ phraseto_tsquery('english', '{search_phrase}')
                        AND source = %s''', (data_source,))
new:
search_phrase = search_phrase.replace("'", "")
        cur.execute(f'''SELECT * FROM vaccine_tweets
                        WHERE ts @@ phraseto_tsquery('english', '{search_phrase}')
                        AND source = %s''', (data_source,))

remove subset words
remove unnecessary words (lymph nodes swollen -> nodes swollen, maybe even just swollen?)
remove disease/phenomenon/syndrome (alport's snydrome -> alport)
remove jargon that people are never gonna use:
    - "vaccine associated enhanced disease"]
    * actually it turns out people use this. You never know what jargon people are going to start using
use some kind of pattern/logic for repetitive sets of symptoms:
        "labored breathing",
        "struggling with breathing",
        "breathing trouble",
        "get breathless",
        "difficulty breathing",
        "breathing difficulties",
        "gasping for air",
        "breathing problems",
        "respiratory symptoms",
        "acute respiratory distress",
        "hard to breathe",
        "barely breathe",
        "difficult breathing",
        "shortness of breath",
        "short of breath",
        "couldn't breathe",
        "barely able to breathe",
        "difficulty of breathing",
        "respiratory distress",
        "difficulty in breathing",
        "loss of breath",
        "breathing issues",
        "lung issues",
        "breathlessness",
        "short of breat",
        "shortness of breathe",
        "struggling to breathe",
        "can barely breathe"
        
chest tightness 
    chest <1/2/3> tight 
    tight <1/2/3> chest
